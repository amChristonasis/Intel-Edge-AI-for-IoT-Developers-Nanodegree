# Smart Queue Monitoring System
Second project for the Intel Edge AI for IoT Developers Nanodegree from Udacity

The purpose of this project was to suggest the right hardware for a queue monitoring system based on cameras for three different real-world hypothetical scenarios.

# Tasks Performed
* Proposed a possible hardware solution
* Built out the application and tested its performance on the DevCloud using multiple hardware types (CPU, I-GPU, FPGA, VPU)
* Compared the performance to see which hardware performed best
* Revised the proposal based on the test results

The three scenarios are:

* Scenario 1: Manufacturing Sector
* Scenario 2: Retail Sector
* Scenario 3: Transportation Sector

The scenarios had different requirements based on the clients needs and budget.

More on that can be found in the Proposal pdf.
